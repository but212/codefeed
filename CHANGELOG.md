## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Order-independent positional source argument resolution.
- Short option aliases (`-o`, `-f`, `-r`, `-h`) and key-value parameter syntax (`--key=val`, `-k=val`).
- POSIX `--` option delimiter to treat subsequent arguments as positional sources.

### Changed

- Refactored CLI parser into a zero-dependency streaming `ArgTokenizer` with semantic token folding.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-11

### Added

- Fast CLI converting local directories or GitHub repositories into LLM-friendly digests.
- Local directory walking with `.gitignore` awareness, hidden file exclusion, and symlink skipping.
- Remote GitHub repository ingestion via Git trees and concurrent blob downloads without local `git` binary.
- Plain text and XML serialization formats (`--format <text|xml>`) with entity escaping and control character sanitization.
- Flexible output destinations: atomic file writing or stdout streaming (`--output -`).
- Git revision selection for remote repositories (`--ref <BRANCH|TAG|COMMIT>`).
- Streaming heuristic token estimation reported in digest and completion summary.
- Built-in sensitive file and credential filtering (`.env*`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `id_rsa*`).
- Conventional lockfile and noise path exclusion before candidate accounting.
- Resource budgets enforcing maximum candidate file counts and output sizes.
